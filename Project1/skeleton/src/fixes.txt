Bugs (MSisms):
define __max() and __min() in ImgFltAux.h (they are in MS stdlib.h but not GNU stdlib.h)
rename typedef Contour that conflicted with ImgView::Contour() (ImgView.h)
added return type to operator<(Node&, Node&) (iScissor.h)

Bugs (just plain broken):
change x to col and y to row in ImgView::PartialExpanding()
catch exceptions (e.g. invalid filename) in ImgView::OpenImage() and SaveContour() and SaveMask()
check for null pointer in ReadFile() and WriteFile() (FileIO.cpp)
remove null pointers in contours[] left by CTypedPtrArray<T>::FreePtrs() in ImgView::FreeBuffer()
snprintf vs sprintf in CError (Image.h)

Bugs remaining:
deleting void* in CRefCntMem::DecrementCount()

Changes:
reads image filename from the command line (thus, made ImgView::OpenImage(char *filename) public)
selected contour is now blue, because I'm red color-blind.
